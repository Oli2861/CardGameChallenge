# CardGameChallenge

I used Mockito to mock the random number generator (Task 1) and also to test the card comparison (Task 3).

For gradle, tests can be executed with the following command:
```bash
./gradlew test
```
Note, that gradle automatically executes tests when building (e.g. with `./gradlew build`).
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
./gradlew run
```

##### Used versions:
- OpenJDK 19.1
- Gradle 8.4
